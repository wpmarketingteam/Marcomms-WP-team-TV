# Marcomms-WPTV-team
This is a place to collaborate and store any Marcomms info related to collboration with the WPTV team, including subtitling and captioning. 
Testing update: as wih polyglots, this will not be an active repository. We will look at whether to keep it for cross-linking tontasks related to wptv, if labelling wptv tasks in other repositories is not sufficient. @vimes1984 to advise if we could use the main wiki for cross promoting rather than needing to keep this and polyglots repository open.
