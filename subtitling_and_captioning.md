Workflow documents to support subtitling and captioning advice and processes


The below will be moved to a post on YouTube once the documentation is ready.
For subtitling files on YouTube livestreams we are working on:
- edit the auto captions generated by YouTue in the studio
- add punctuation and capital letters for new sentences
- update any wordpress references to WordPress
- remove any 'ums' etc and adjust timings to help give an easier to follow version for those who may be translating the subtitles and to make it easier to follow for those who need access to the subtitles. Note, if there are a lot of words that need to be cut out, please discuss with the task facilitator to explore how this can be subtitled to help those who may be lip reading
- where there are loud sounds or movement which are referred to or audience may hear, then add caption information in square brackets
- moving captions to next screens to avoid having too many words on one screen
- check timings
- download a completed draft once one of us has tried the subtitles on another browser. This document will also be useful if snippets are used for a composite on WordPress.tv or if an edited stream is to be made into a talk video for that site
- publish the subtitles
- add a reference to subtitles available high up on the video descriptor
- mark the video as subtitled in the task list

This subtitles checklist for YouTube videos does not apply to the onboarding ones were the captions are embedded onto the video itself. A guide on captioning these is being produced.
